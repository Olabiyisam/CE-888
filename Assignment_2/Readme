This repository contains two codes

Originally it should contain the data but due to privacy reasons this is not available. Data used for this code is the Agrotech dataset (Matran-Fernandez, Jan 2022)
The agrotech_py model as a .py file and the Experiment notebook as ipynb file (notebook file) 

The Experiment notebook is where all experiments were carried out on the dataset 

The data needed to run this code is the agrotech dataset as it in in Xlsx format (Matran-Fernandez, Jan 2022)

The notebook is a walkthrough of how the modelling and the predictions were implemented

The agrotech_py.py is the experiment code and can be run in a python installed enviroment 
Note all libaries required should be installed using !pip intall Libaries such as Xgboost, Lightgbm etc as seen in the first code bock of the code.

Also due to data privacy related reasons the Yield predictions of this experiment was also not added to this repository. 
Although this can be generated by running the code with the data when accessed or provided
